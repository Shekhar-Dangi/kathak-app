          Studying for exams is always stressful, but it becomes even harder
          when there is as much content as there is in Kathak. Even a Part
          3(lower level) exam, has up to three years of content. However, donâ€™t
          fret. You can utilize the resources in this website to study for your
          upcoming exam or even just keep your knowledge of Kathak terms fresh!
