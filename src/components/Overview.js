        <h2 className="heading">HISTORY OF KATHAK</h2>
        <p className="paragraph">
          The story of Kathak begins in ancient times with the performances of
          professional story-tellers called kathakas who recited or sang stories
          from epics and mythology with some elements of dance. The traditions
          of the kathakas were hereditary, and dances passed from generation to
          generation. There are literary references from the third and fourth
          centuries BC which refer to these kathakas.

        <h2 className="heading">GENERAL KATHAK TIMELINE</h2>
        <p className="paragraph">
          <strong>Bhakti Era</strong> - Kathak was very religious at this time;
          it was mostly used to depict the lives of holy figures like Krishna
          and Radha <br />
          <strong>Persian & Mughal Influence</strong> - Kathak got its its
          distinctive features here. Rather than being strictly religious, it
          began to take a role in entertainment. There was lots of distinctive
          footwork, sharp spins, as well as beautiful emotions and expressions
          within the dances <br />
          <strong>During the Raj</strong> - Kathak began to decline in this time
          as British rule began in India. The British administrators thought
          Kathak was unruly and had seductive motions. Rise of Kathak - Kathak
          began to rise under Pt. Thakyr Prasad Ji. It was reintroduced under
          the name of Nathawari Nritya. <br />
          <strong>Today</strong> - Kathak is now regonized as one of the 8
          classical dance forms of India. Expressive motion, rythmic accuracy,
          graceful turning, posied stances, technical clarity, hand
          gestures(mudras), and subtle expression(bhava-abhinaya) are important
          facets of modern Kathak
        </p>
        <h2 className="heading">DETAILED KATHAK TIMELINE</h2>
        <p className="paragraph">
          <strong>Bhakti Era</strong> - During the era of fervent worship of
          Radha-Krishna, Kathak was used to narrate tales from the lives of
          these figures. Popular performances included Sri Krishna’s exploits in
          the holy land of Vrindavan, and tales of Krishna-Leela (Krishna’s
          childhood). After Mughal influence, the dance moved away from the
          spirituality of the temple. <br /> <br />
          <strong>Persian & Mughal Influence</strong> - It was when the dance
          reached the Mughal court after the 15th Century that Kathak began to
          acquire its distinctive shape and features. Here it encountered other
          different forms of dance and music, most especially dancers from
          Persia. Dancers were enticed from the temples to the courts by gifts
          of gold, jewels and royal favor. The environment of the North Indian
          Mughal courts caused a shift in focus from a purely religious art form
          to entertainment. The demi-plié stance of most other Indian dance
          forms gave way to straight legs taken from the Persian dancers. To
          emphasize the elaborate rhythmic footwork as many as 150 ankle bells
          on each leg were worn. It was also during this period that the
          signature 'chakkars' (spins) of Kathak was introduced. The
          straight-legged position gave a new vitality to the footwork, which
          wove percussive rhythms in its own right, whether together with or in
          complement to the Tabla or Pakhawaj . Kathak remained a solo art form,
          based on personal interpretations and emotional values. The beautiful
          (but copious) jewelry and costume of the dancers combined with poetic
          narration to tell fabulous tales of drama, triumph, and tragedy. The
          music, atmosphere, and themes developed through the fusion of cultures
          in a way that no other dance could <br /> <br />
          <strong>Later Court Influences</strong> - Many specific emperors
          contributed to the growth and development of Kathak into different
          gharanas, or schools of dance, named after the cities in which they
          developed. The Nawab Wajid Ali Shah not only enjoyed giving patronage
          to dancers but danced himself. He himself choreographed a dance,
          Rahas, that he danced himself with the ladies of his court. He brought
          teachers to his palaces, aiding the expansion of technical vocabulary,
          and formed the basis of the Lucknow gharana, emphasizing sensuous,
          expressive emotion. The Lucknow gharana placed emphasis on the
          abhinaya and natya elements or expressional qualities of the dancing;
          it was famed for its subtlety and grace (nazakat). This contrasted
          sharply with the Jaipur gharana, which became renowned for highly
          intricate and complex footwork, and fast, sharp, and accurate dancing.
          Even after the Mughuls, courts in Rajastan enjoyed Kathak as a
          sophisticated art form, fostering the growth of the Jaipur gharana.
          The Banaras gharana was also created in this time. <br /> <br />
          <strong>During the Raj</strong> - With the advent of British Rule in
          India, Kathak went into sharp decline. The Victorian administrators
          publicly pronounced it a base and unlovely form of entertainment,
          despite often privately enjoying the pleasures of the tawaif. Kathak
          was, to Victorian eyes, an entertainment designed solely for the
          purposes of seduction. During these times of cultural hardship, the
          role of the tawaifs in preserving the art forms should not be
          underestimated. Famous tawaifs such as Gauhar Jan were instrumental in
          the maintenance and continuation of Kathak, even as it was officially
          denigrated by the prevailing political opinion. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Rise of Kathak</strong> - Pt. Thakur Prasad Ji had a dream of
          Lord Krishna and implored him to restart Kathak so that society will
          accept Kathak. Krishna told Pt. Thakur Prasad Ji, to start the whole
          thing in his name. Start telling the stories of your gods and
          goddesses. This started Nathawari Nritya. Pt. Thakur Prasad Ji
          restarted the kathak in the name of Nathawari Nritya. He dragged
          Kathak to spirituality, instead of dance for entertainment. People
          started to do thumri, telling the stories of Rama Krishna as a dance
          drama. This all took place in the Nathawari Nritya. <br /> <br />
          <strong>Today</strong> - Today, Kathak has regained its popularity
          after the period of decline during the rule of the British emperor
          where it was frowned upon by Victorian administrators. Not only in
          India, but throughout the world, it is recognized as one of the seven
          classical dance forms of India. Kathak’s unique history has made it
          very different from other traditional dance forms, although it still
          retains the same roots. Presently, this classical dance is
          characterized by a combination of the temple and court forms,
          inclusive of both the devotion and romantic form that has shaped it
          through the years. The influence of theater dance has presented itself
          in the movement towards dance productions of stories such as
          Shakuntala. Expressive motion, rhythmic accuracy, graceful turning,
          poised stances, technical clarity, hand gestures (mudras) and subtle
          expression (bhava-abhinaya) are important components of modern Kathak.
          The work of the Maharaj family of dancers (Acchan Maharaj , Shambhu
          Maharaj , Lachchu Maharaj) <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Gharanas</strong> - Because of the linear nature of the
          passing of knowledge from guru to shishya, certain stylistic and
          technical features began to fossilise and became hallmarks of a
          particular school, guru or group of teachers. The different styles are
          known as gharanas, and these are: <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Lucknow Gharna</strong> - The Lucknow Gharana developed in the
          courts of the Nawab of Oudh in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. It particularly
          emphasises grace, elegance and naturalness in the dance. Abhinaya or
          expressional acting, especially improvised, plays a very strong role
          in this style. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Jaipur Gharana</strong> - The Jaipur Gharana developed in the
          courts of the Kachchwaha kings of Jaipur in Rajasthan. Importance is
          placed on the more technical aspects of dance, such as complex and
          powerful footwork, multiple spins, and complicated compositions in
          different talas. There is also a greater incorporation of compositions
          from the pakhawaj, such as parans. <br />
          <br />
          <strong> Banaras Gharana</strong> - The Benaras Gharana was developed
          by Janakiprasad. It is characterized by the exclusive use of the
          natwari or dance bols, which are different from the tabla and the
          pakhawaj bols. There are differences in the thaat and tatkaar, and
          chakkars are kept at a minimum but are often taken from both the
          right- and the left-hand sides with equal confidence.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong> Raigarh Gharana</strong>- This was established by the
          Maharaja Chakradhar Singh in the princely state of Raigarh in
          Chhatisgarh in the early 20th century. The Maharaja invited many
          luminaries of Kathak (as well as famous percussionists) to his court,
          including Kalka Prasad(the father of Acchan, Lacchu and Shambhu
          Maharaj) and his sons, and Pandit Jailal from Jaipur gharana. The
          confluence of different styles and artists created a unique
          environment for the development of new Kathak and tabla compositions
          drawn from various backgrounds. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Ghunghru</strong> - 
          <i> Ghunghru or ghunghroo </i> are the small bells the dancer ties around
          his or her ankles. The Kathak bells are different from those of other
          Indian dance styles, as they are not affixed to a pad or strip of
          leather, but rather are individually woven along a thick string. The
          usual number of bells is 100 on each ankle, although for the initial
          stages of learning or for children, 25 and 50 belled strings are
          widely available to allow the dancer to get used to them. There is a
          more or less accepted upper ceiling of 150 bells on each ankle.
          Greater figures than this tend to involve the topmost circle of bells
          being tied further and further up a dancer's calf. This is generally
          regarded as unsuitable, because it is at some distance from the point
          of impact, giving rise to the upper levels of bells being prone to
          delayed sounding given the intervening space and amount of leg.
          Greater numbers are also unnecessarily difficult to control since they
          are more likely to sound at unwanted moments, being affected by the
          movement of the whole of the lower leg, rather than just the ankle.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Costume</strong> - As the dance style itself has changed to
          reflect the different milieus in which it found itself, so too has the
          costume and performance dress of the dancers. <br />
          <br />
          <strong> Female costume</strong> - Traditional (and perhaps more
          specifically Hindu) costume sometimes consists of a sari, whether worn
          in an everyday style, or tied up to allow greater freedom of movement
          during dance. However, more commonly, the costume is a lehenga-choli
          combination, with an optional odhni or veil. The lehenga is loose
          ankle-length skirt, and the choli is a tight fitting blouse, usually
          short-sleeved. Both can be highly ornately embroidered or decorated.
          The lehenga is sometimes adapted to a special dance variety, similar
          to a long ghaghra, so that during spins, the skirt flares out
          dramatically. Mughal costume for women consists of an angarkha (from
          the Sanskrit anga-rakshaka 'limb-keeper') on the upper body. The
          design is akin to a Churidar - Kamiz but is somewhat tighter fitting
          above the waist, and the 'skirt' portion explicitly cut on the round
          to enhance the flare of the lower half during spins. Beneath this, the
          legs are covered by the chudidaar or figure hugging trousers folded up
          giving the look of cloth bangles. Optional accessories are a small
          peaked cap and a bandi or small waistcoat to enhance the bust-line. A
          belt made of zari or precious stones is also worn on the waist. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Male costume</strong> - The traditional Hindu costume for men
          to be bare-chested. Below the waist is the dhoti, usually tied in the
          Bengal style, that is with many pleats and a fan finish to one of the
          ends (although it is not unknown for dancers to tie the garment more
          simply). There is the option of wearing a men's bandi too. The Mughal
          costume is kurta-churidar. The kurta can be a simple one, or again,
          adapted for dance to incorporate wider flare, but is usually at least
          knee-length. Men may also wear an angarkha (see Female Costume,
          above). Particularly older variety costumes include the small peaked
          cap too.
