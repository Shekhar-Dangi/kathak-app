          Since kathak, as you can tell, has a rich history, there are also
          certain facets of it that might not be familiar to the average person.
          This page has compiled a multitude of vocab terms/specialities of
          kathak that you might not already know. The terms are organized
          alphabetically, so if you wish to find one word in particular, you may

  Ada: <br />
  In Kathak dance when we show or express a facial emotion during our dance presentation, then it’s called Ada. Ada is also called Hela. When a dancer shows any incident, a story, or a certain emotion in front of the audience, through her expression or bhav, then it is called Ada. Usually these expressions are shown while dancing Thumri or some song. The example of Ada can be seen in Makanchori when Mother Yashoda is about to hit Krishna so he starts crying, and she puts him on her lap. In this the dancer is showing Batsiya Raas. This whole act is called Ada.

</p>

<p className="paragraph">
Kataksha: <br />
In Hindi language, Kataksh means to look at someone from the corner of your eyes in a judgemental way. In Kathak, however, it carries a completely different meaning. While presenting any bole, tora, or tihai, we finish it on som and give a sharp, quick gaze towards the right/left side of the room. While doing this act, we keep gazing at one corner for a few seconds which is called Kataksh. We can also say that the act of the quick glance towards any corner while dancing is called Kataksh. 
</p>

</p>

Natavari bole is derived from the stomping of Krishna’s feet. After defeating the serpent king Kaliya, Lord Krishna went on the Serpent’s head(1000 heads) and started smashing down each of his heads with his foot stomps(1 stomp=1 head destroyed). The dance which Lord Krishna did on Kaliya’s head is called Natavari Bole. Natavar is the name of Lord Krishna hence this bole is called Natavari Bole. This bole has slow and fast movement, lots of spinning, as well as intense footwork. 
</p>

<p className="paragraph">
Nritta: <br />
Nritta means pure dance steps performed rhythmically. Here the movements of the body do not show any mood or meaning and its purpose is just creating beauty by making various patterns and poses on rhythm.

Nritya corresponds to the mime often performed to the song. It has emphasis on the expressive part of dance.
</p>

<p className="paragraph">
Padant: <br />
When we sing or dance a tabla or pakhawaj bole in a certain taal and laya with proper taali-khali, then it is called Padant. Padant helps the audience to relate themselves with the performance, whereas it helps the dancer to explain the critical aspects of any bole and create an understanding between the dancer and audience. Padant makes the performance more attractive and easy to understand. It always follows the same style while singing the bole. Padant is one of the main aspects of Kathak. We don’t see much use of Padant in other classical dances. 
</p>

<p className="paragraph">
Palta: <br />
Palta is used when you’re making a change during your dance. You use it when changing from one pose to another, one character to another, or one section to the other. It comes from “palat dena” which means to give a turn. You can either go from right to left or left to right. 
Gaat when we change from chalan-phiran to nikas, we must use Palta
Most of the time in Gaat we use palta before switching to Tihai
While dancing Gaatbahv, when changing from one character to another, the dancer uses palta
</p>

<p className="paragraph">
Paran: <br />
When we take Pakhawaj words in kathak and make a bole, then it is called Paran. Paran is danced in Madhya Laya and Drut Laya. Paran is NEVER danced in Vilambit Laya. When paran is danced in Vilambit Laya it becomes Paran Jodi Aamad. 
</p>

<p className="paragraph">
Paran Jodi Aamad v.s. Paran:<br />
Paran Jodi Aamad is a type of aamad where we add a paran in front of an aamad in Vilambit laya and the whole paran is danced in vilambit laya only. However, paran is the fast pace pakhawaj words danced in Madhya or Drut laya only. 
</p>

<p className="paragraph">
Pataka: <br />
Pataka is the very first asanyukt mudra mentioned in the book of mudras. This is a one handed gesture, or asanyukt mudra. We have 2 books on mudras. Number 1 is Abhinaya Darpan which is written by pandit Nandikeshvara. Number 2 is Natya Shastra which is written by Bharata Muni. According to Abhinaya Darpan there are 28 asanyuky mudras, whereas in Natya Shastra we find 24 asanyukt mudras. Pataka is the first mudra in both these books. For making Pataka we stretch our palm all the way straight and keep all our 4 fingers joined together while the thumb should be pressed to the side of the palm. Pataka means flag, so in this mudras we keep all our fingers straight upwards. We use pataka to show blessings, a mirror, a slap, during meditation, etc.
