          Since kathak, as you can tell, has a rich history, there are also
          certain facets of it that might not be familiar to the average person.
          This page has compiled a multitude of vocab terms/specialities of
          kathak that you might not already know. The terms are organized
          alphabetically, so if you wish to find one word in particular, you may
          do so.

Aamad:  <br />
Aamad is a Persian word, which means an “entrance.” This piece is danced in the beginning of your Nritta. 
<br />
Ada: <br />
In Kathak dance when we show or express a facial emotion during our dance presentation, then it’s called Ada. Ada is also called Hela. When a dancer shows any incident, a story, or a certain emotion in front of the audience, through her expression or bhav, then it is called Ada. Usually these expressions are shown while dancing Thumri or some song. The example of Ada can be seen in Makanchori when Mother Yashoda is about to hit Krishna so he starts crying, and she puts him on her lap. In this the dancer is showing Batsiya Raas. This whole act is called Ada. 
<br />
Ang: <br />
In Carnatic Sangeet Phadyati(uses VTP), change of beats in a certain time frame is called Ang. Ang is distributed in 8 parts: Laghu, Guru, Drut, Anudrut, Labiram, Dabiram, Pluta, and Kakpad. It is called layakari in Uttar Bharatiya sangeet. 
<br />
Angya: <br />
According to Natya shastra(A book of kathak) which is the earliest literature of Music and drama written by Bharat Muni, it has 6 body parts or angya that are used during dance <br />
<List list={["Head",
"Hand" ,
"Waist",
"Chest",
"Sides",
"Leg"]} />

Asama Bibhag Taal v.s. Normal/Sama Bibhag Taal: <br />
In Asama Bibhag Taal the bibhads are not equally divided, but in Sama Bibhag Taal the bibhads are equally divided <br />

Avartan:  <br />
One full cycle of any taal is called an Avartan. While singing Teentaal when we count from 1-16, that is called one avartan. 

<br />
Baat: <br />
When we take a couple of similar words and arrange/rearrange those to make different rhythm, that is called Baat <br />
Baat 1 - 16 Tatkar <br />
Baat 2 - Ta Thei Tat Ta Thei Thei Tat…  <br />
Baat 3- Takita Takita Taka…  <br />

Badamdar: <br />
No breath(no gap) <br />

Bhajan:  <br />
A Hindu devotional song. Bhajans are sometimes used as light
classical repertoire. <br />

Bibhag:  <br />
The division of a Taal is called “Bibhag.” The sign for a Bibhag is a small straight vertical line(/). <br />

Bole:  <br />
A complete composition of dance is called “bole.” Examples are tukras, toras, and tihai.  <br />

Chakradhar Tihai: <br />
When we repeat a Tihai 3 times, then it is called Chakradhar Tihai. In this process we repeat a small bole 9 times(3+3+3).
According to the 2nd definition, when a Tihai goes more than 1 avartan, it becomes Chakradhar Tihai. In this process a bole repeats only 3 times but the bole is so long that it goes more than 1 avartan while repeated 3 times.<br />

Chakradhar Tora: <br />
When a Tora or a Toda is performed three times w/o any change; it is called a Chakradhar Tora.  <br />

Chakradhar Tukra: <br />
A tukra danced 3 times without any change. <br />

Chand Ki Layakari: <br />
Doesn’t have a specific taal. But for our convenience, we use teentaal but not the vani/tatkar. We use numbers instead of words. When we show different layakari, rhythm sounds, and how they’re distinct from each other(shown with foot movements), then it is called chand ki layakari. <br />


Chaugun: <br />
Fourth speed. Four beats into one beat or 4 times the speed of the basic time cycle. <br />

Damdar: <br />
To take a breath(gap)<br />

Dance: <br />
When you move your body in rhythm then it’s called dance. It has two parts - Nritta and Nritya.<br />

Dogun:<br />
Double speed. Two beats into one beat or double the speed of the basic time cycle. <br />

Dipalli Paran: <br />
When we repeat each word of Paran twice, then it is called ‘Dipalli Paran.’<br />

Ekgun:<br />
Slow speed. One beat for every beat. For example: 1 2. <br />

Gaat: <br />
Gaat is a part of Nritta where we show different characters, poses, and feelings. It is always set on a certain Taal. We show animals and birds in Gaat such as elephants, deers, snakes as well as birds such as peacocks. Gaat is always danced in Drut Laya. Also for any taal, tatkar or gaat are both set on “char ka chand.”
Parts of Gaat:
Sthai: It tells the rhythm of Gaat
Chalan-Phiran: Moving forward is called Chalan and walking backward is called Phiran
Palta: When we spin right to left and left to right, it is called Palta. We use this for changing one character to another or changing from one chalan to another chalan
Nikas: Taking pose during Gaat, determines what kind of Gaat we are presenting
Tihai: We end Gaat with a Tihai
Specialities of Gaat
Gaat is danced in Drut Laya but we stop half of its beat
Gaat always starts 1 matra before ‘Som’
Gaat should consist of 5 parts
Even though Gaat is a part of Nritta, we also always show facial expression while presenting Gaat



Gaatbhav: 
Gaatbhav consists of many gaats by which we depict a story. In gaatbhav, one dancer changes characters during palta. Gaatbhav may or may not have a song at the end(song is an optional part). We show different expressions but Gaatbhav still comes under Nrita. If we use a song, it goes under Nritya. 

Gharana: 
A tradition or lineage within north indian classical music. Each gharana has certain characteristics of style and emphasis. Most take their names from the locations where their founders came from.

Ghumariya: 
While dancing, when we spin, that is called ghumariya. This also has 2 other names - Bhamari or Phirkani. In Kathak we have a distinct use of ghumariya, and this is also considered to be a special feature of kathak. In some folk dances we also see the use of ghumariya. Examples are garba from Gujarat and ghoomar from Rajasthan. 

Hastak: 
The hand movements in Kathak are called Hastak. There are two kinds of Hastak: Asanyukt(one handed) and Sanyukt(both handed)

Kasak-Masak: 
While dancing, when we move our wrist beautifully and with full control, it is called Kasak. It is also called Kalas and is very subtle. The controlled chest movement while breathing in or out is called Masak. While dancing, we use Masak in many places to add beauty to the pose. 
Kasak and Masak is often used together like challan-phiran in gaat. Most of the time, we use Kasak-Masak during Thaat. But we also see the use of Kasak in Toras. 

Kataksha: 
In Hindi language, Kataksh means to look at someone from the corner of your eyes in a judgemental way. In Kathak, however, it carries a completely different meaning. While presenting any bole, tora, or tihai, we finish it on som and give a sharp, quick gaze towards the right/left side of the room. While doing this act, we keep gazing at one corner for a few seconds which is called Kataksh. We can also say that the act of the quick glance towards any corner while dancing is called Kataksh. 

Kavitangi:
In Kavitangi we set a poem on a particular taal or bole from dance, tabla, or Pakhawaj. 


Khali:
The word khali means empty. When we shake our hand on hair and do not make any sound, then it is called Khali. Khali is denoted by the sign ‘0’.

Laya:
Rhythm or tempo. Laya is a continuous movement in space of time. Music and dance without Laya will be as a body without bones. 

Laya v.s. Layakari
Laya is the speed of our dance recital whereas Layakari is the speed of a Taal.
Examples of Laya are Vilambit, Madhya, and Drut and examples of Layakari Ekgun, Dogun, and Chargun
We show different Layas while dancing different boles but we show the whole Layakari in the beginning of our dance recital
In Layakari we don’t use any movements
There are only 3 layas in kathak but there are many “layakari” in Kathak

Matra: 
Beats (clap and count 1,2,3,4)
Vilambit Laya: The slow tempo
Madhya Laya: The moderate or medium tempo
Drut Laya: The fast tempo

Natavari Bole:
Natavari bole is derived from the stomping of Krishna’s feet. After defeating the serpent king Kaliya, Lord Krishna went on the Serpent’s head(1000 heads) and started smashing down each of his heads with his foot stomps(1 stomp=1 head destroyed). The dance which Lord Krishna did on Kaliya’s head is called Natavari Bole. Natavar is the name of Lord Krishna hence this bole is called Natavari Bole. This bole has slow and fast movement, lots of spinning, as well as intense footwork. 

Nritta: 
Nritta means pure dance steps performed rhythmically. Here the movements of the body do not show any mood or meaning and its purpose is just creating beauty by making various patterns and poses on rhythm.

Nritya: 
Nritya corresponds to the mime often performed to the song. It has emphasis on the expressive part of dance.


Padant: 
When we sing or dance a tabla or pakhawaj bole in a certain taal and laya with proper taali-khali, then it is called Padant. Padant helps the audience to relate themselves with the performance, whereas it helps the dancer to explain the critical aspects of any bole and create an understanding between the dancer and audience. Padant makes the performance more attractive and easy to understand. It always follows the same style while singing the bole. Padant is one of the main aspects of Kathak. We don’t see much use of Padant in other classical dances. 

Palta: 
Palta is used when you’re making a change during your dance. You use it when changing from one pose to another, one character to another, or one section to the other. It comes from “palat dena” which means to give a turn. You can either go from right to left or left to right. 
Gaat when we change from chalan-phiran to nikas, we must use Palta
Most of the time in Gaat we use palta before switching to Tihai
While dancing Gaatbahv, when changing from one character to another, the dancer uses palta

Paran: 
When we take Pakhawaj words in kathak and make a bole, then it is called Paran. Paran is danced in Madhya Laya and Drut Laya. Paran is NEVER danced in Vilambit Laya. When paran is danced in Vilambit Laya it becomes Paran Jodi Aamad. 


Paran Jodi Aamad v.s. Paran:
Paran Jodi Aamad is a type of aamad where we add a paran in front of an aamad in Vilambit laya and the whole paran is danced in vilambit laya only. However, paran is the fast pace pakhawaj words danced in Madhya or Drut laya only. 
 
Pataka: 
Pataka is the very first asanyukt mudra mentioned in the book of mudras. This is a one handed gesture, or asanyukt mudra. We have 2 books on mudras. Number 1 is Abhinaya Darpan which is written by pandit Nandikeshvara. Number 2 is Natya Shastra which is written by Bharata Muni. According to Abhinaya Darpan there are 28 asanyuky mudras, whereas in Natya Shastra we find 24 asanyukt mudras. Pataka is the first mudra in both these books. For making Pataka we stretch our palm all the way straight and keep all our 4 fingers joined together while the thumb should be pressed to the side of the palm. Pataka means flag, so in this mudras we keep all our fingers straight upwards. We use pataka to show blessings, a mirror, a slap, during meditation, etc. 



Prattangya:
It comprises all types of joints which we can fold during dance. There are 9 different types of Prattangya. 
Neck
Shoulder
Elbow
Wrist
Knee
Ankle
Back
Stomach
Upper thigh/Hip

Salami v.s. Aamad: 
Differences:
Salami means salutations and Aamad means entrance
In Salami we do not have symmetrical movement but in Aamad we do
In Salami we do salam and namaste but in Aamad we do  not
Similarities:
Beginning of Vilambit Laya
Are in beginning of recital
Are both in Nritta

Salami: 
The word “salami” literally means salutation. In ancient times a dancer used to greet Rajas and Badshahs with Salami bole. Now while performing salami, the dancer honors the audience by saluting it in a special manner. Salami is performed in the beginning of the performance. 

Stuti: 
Slokas in Sanskrit Language are called Stuti. 

Sum/Som: 
Arrival point of a Tal. Returning on the first beat after completing a time cycle. Sum is the first beat of any Taal and is accented more than any other bears. Sum is denoted by the sign ‘X’. 

Taali: 
Taali means clapping. Besides Sum the other beats in Tal on which we clap are called Tali. 



Tal: 
Tal is a group of certain beats. Tal is a very important concept in Classical Indian dance and music.

Tallipi Padhyati:
2 Types: Vishnudigambar Tallipi Padhyati(VTP) and Bhatkhande Tallipi Padhyati(BTP)
In North Indian classical music we use Bhatkhande Tallipi Padhyati. In South Indian music we use Vishnudigambar Tallipi Padhyati.
In Kathak we use BTP and in Carnatic Sangeet we use VTP

Tatkar: 
The dance syllables that are produced from stomping are called Tatkar. In Kathak dance the main syllables of Tatkar are: Ta, Thei, Tat, Aa. Kathak dancers usually perform many variations of this basic Tatkar.

Thaat: 
Thaat is the introduction of the dance movements and rhythm. The dancer uses gentle and delicate movements of wrist, neck, eye, and eyebrow. It also includes slow paced inhalations and exhalations. It is always done in Vilambit Laya. 

Theka: 
The original bole of any taal is called Theka. All taal have their unique theka.
